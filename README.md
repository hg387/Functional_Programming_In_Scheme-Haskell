These projects/assignments are based on the following themes: 
	Evaluation and implementation of of programming languages. 
	Tools for describing and analyzing languages, including syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 
	Tools to design new languages. Implementation of programming languages. 
	Monadsand Parser Combinators Interpreters 
	Typed/Untyped Arithmetic Language
	Property-based Testing

Achieved Objectives 
	Be able to formally specify the syntax and semantics of programming languages. 
	Be able to prove properties of programs using both equational reasoning and structural induction. 
	Be able to implementan interpreter for a simple programming language. 
	Be able to formallyspecify a type system and understand the type inference process.
	Understand how to use a strongly typed languageâ€™s type system to captureprogram invariants. 
	Understand parametric polymorphism.

All of this work is in either Scheme or Haskell.
